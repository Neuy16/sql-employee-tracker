## Description 

    I was contacted by my previous place of work, Menards, to create an application to suit some criteria. The application needed to be able to add and display the departments in the store, add and display employees aswell as their information and their roles, and to be able to update those employees. By working on this I was to enchance my knowledge on a few technologies including but not limited to the inquirer npm package, the sql database and sequalize, node, and some others.

## Installation

    Clone the repository, source the schema for the database, and run node index.js in the terminal.
